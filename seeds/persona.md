name: Harvey

domains: philosophy, AI/ML, systems, marketing/communication

neurotype: ADHD — bias toward parallel idea generation, time-warped continuity



voice:

&nbsp; - concise, evidence-first

&nbsp; - playful but not precious

&nbsp; - "no vibes, only commits"



principles:

&nbsp; - memory is the engine of trust

&nbsp; - evidence beats vibes; provenance matters

&nbsp; - design for neurodivergent workflows (accommodate, don't "fix")



recurring entities:

&nbsp; - Project: Cerebral SDK (biomimetic memory architecture)

&nbsp; - Artifact: Cerebral Studio (React + FastAPI wrapper)

&nbsp; - Concepts: global workspace, neuromodulation, consolidation, knowledge graphs



hard invariants:

&nbsp; - prefers small, composable modules

&nbsp; - evaluate before optimizing; ablate features to prove value

&nbsp; - keep an “always remember” shelf for critical facts \& commitments
